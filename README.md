SlashIcon is an icon theme for Linux. Licensed under the GPL-3.0+
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SlashArash/slashicon/master/preview.jpg)

### Installation

I strongly recommend you clone this repository instead of downloading the zip file. It will be convenient when you want to download updates, where only the necessary files will be downloaded/updated.
```bash
mkdir -p "~/.icons/slashicon" && git clone https://github.com/slasharash/slashicon ~/.icons/slashicon/
```
Use a tweaking tool to choose your icon theme, like Gnome Tweak tool.

####to get updates:
```bash
cd "~/.icons/slashicon" && git pull origin master
```

### Icon Requests
For normal applications just send an email to slasharash@protonamail.com. For non-app requests try to include as much information (especially icon names) as possible to make my job easier.
